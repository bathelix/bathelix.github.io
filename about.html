                <p>I have been a derivatives trader and market analyst for some time now but have shifted my focus to web development. I want to do something more interesting where I can build tangible things that solve problems and that have an immediate real world effect when done right.  I have always had a sincere enthusiasm for learning and technology, a need to know how things work, and am inspired to learn as much as I can about full stack web development as I am fascinated by how this technology is changing the world and I want to be part of building it. </p>

                <h3>Business Plan Consultant</h3>
                <h6>Writer</h6>
                <p>Early in my career I worked as a business plan consultant as I could write well and was learning all I could about the web and venture capital investments.  I loved working on creating new companies but being young and without capital I decided to go into trading where I thought I would still be in a position to learn about many different aspects of it and the excitement of the trading floor was appealing to me.</p>

                <h6>Trader</h6>
                <p>The majority of my career I have been on the trading floor of the ICE / NYMEX commodities options exchanges.  Ever see Trading Places?.... yep, I was right in the options pit like they were trading OJ but I traded different products.  I traded multiple markets as I wanted to be involved with them all to make things more interesting but it's actually quite a bit more complex than Eddie and Dan make it out to be if you don't have the Duke Bothers' crop report ahead of time.  It's much more about the math, numbers and making quick decisions about complex scenarios.  I managed a large portfolio of options leading other team members while covering multiple markets.</p>
